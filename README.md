# Pop-a-Task
Pop A Task is a simple task-reminder tool that lets users invite other users to create or modify tasks, discuss the work that needs to be done, and reach the milestone in a set period of time. Members can communicate with one another via the chat tool, a shared note, and a shared calendar event. This application can be used at home, in a small group, or in a small business.
